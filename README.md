## Running extention locally

- Your extention is loaded sucessfully, you don't even need to click it, just go to any leetcode problem and extention will start working

## How to build locally
- Clone project
- Open in any editor of your choice
- If you want to add/remove code then react code is present under `src/`, which you can edit
- Now run `npm run build` to create a loadable build/ folder
- Now to actually test changes we need to load the extention in browser so go to `chrome://extentions` through browser searchbar
- Toggle developer mode on top right in order to enable it
- Click Load unpacked and choose the `build` folder in root of this project
- Your extention is loaded sucessfully, you don't even need to click it, just go to any leetcode problem and extention will start working
